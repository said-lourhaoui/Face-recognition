# Face-recognition

In this project, we will apply different pattern recognition techniques to construct a face
recognition system. First, we will study PCA for Feature Extraction, Visualization and Classification, then we will apply LDA for Feature Extraction and Classification. In addition, we will study
GMM and apply it for clustering. Finally, we will use Neural Networks to classify images.
The data set we will be using is the CMU PIE. The CMU PIE contains 68
subjects, each subject contain several images.
In each part, 25 subjects will be selected randomly out the 68 subjects, then 70 % will be used
for training and 30 % for testing.

## How to run the codes ?
- Make sure the following modules are already installed : sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, mpl_toolkits, keras.
- Start the Notebook Server : "jupyter notebook"  from the command line.
- Browse to the directory containing the scripts.
- Run each cell from the top. 

- You can run a specific Notebook directly from the command line.
- For example to launch PCA.ipynb, use the command : jupyter notebook PCA.ipynb
